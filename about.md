Unicorn In The Shell aims to democratize machine learning knowledge with a focus on practical implementations and compelling applications. We are a team of machine learning practitioners interested in solving tough problems and sharing that knowledge with the public. More a forum and a community than a definitive source of truth, Unicorn In The Shell hopes to be a resource to developers and practitioners alike.



Expect to find posts ranging from:

* Paper summarizations
* Algorithm Implementations
* Case Studies on Real Datasets
* Full Stack [Machine Learning] Data Science. From data, to model, to a working application online!
* Publishing problem discussions? What would it need to solve X.

We are open to collaborations! Find us on Github!
